### How to Run This Demo
1.  **GCP Authentication:** Make sure your local environment is authenticated to Google Cloud. The simplest way is to run:
    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```
2.  **Set GCP Project ID:** The application now reads the GCP Project ID from an environment variable.

3.  **Install Libraries:** Ensure you have the required libraries installed from the updated `dashboard_requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r dashboard_requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run the App:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run streamlit_dashboard.py
    ```
