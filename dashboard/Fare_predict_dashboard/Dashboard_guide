### How to Run This Demo
1.  **GCP Authentication:** Make sure your local environment is authenticated to Google Cloud. The simplest way is to run:
    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```
2.  **Set GCP Project ID:** The application now reads the GCP Project ID from an environment variable.
    *   **Temporary (for current terminal session):**
        ```bash
        $env:GCP_PROJECT_ID="nyc-taxi-project-478411" # For PowerShell
        export GCP_PROJECT_ID="nyc-taxi-project-478411" # For Bash/Zsh
        ```
    *   **(Optional) Persistent setup:** Add the `export GCP_PROJECT_ID="nyc-taxi-project-478411"` line to your shell's profile file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `config.fish`, or system environment variables on Windows).

3.  **Install Libraries:** Ensure you have the required libraries installed from the updated `dashboard_requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r dashboard_requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run the App:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run streamlit_dashboard.py
    ```
